            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There was another kind of Philoſophers that were far more diſdainful and ſtrange, that did not content their fantaſtical humours, only to murmur againſt nature, or complain of her works and effects; but with ſo great, mortall, and unnatural hatred did perſecute man, as if they thought he was born for the onely mark

Other Creatures do not ſo, for they content themſelves with what nature hath provided for them, eating it as it is, without boyling, roaſting, or otherways dreſſing it, to content their appetite or pleaſing their fancies; and with this ſhe hath beſtowed upon them ſuch a regulated contentment, that they eat or drink

He muſt be according to their fond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, or elſe a Commonwealth for them: Our vicious flatterrers will have none of S. <hi>John Baptiſts</hi> ridged and rough way of living; his courſe garment doth not pleaſe their palates: No, no, they ſeek for enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in the Courts of Kings and Princes of the Earth, all their employment is to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56207:30"/> ſeek their own pleaſures and delights; this is the greateſt of their cares, and for this they watch night and day; and to obtain this their deſire, they employ all their prudence and induſtry: But in vain do theſe men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and vex their ſpirits, to put a gloſs or cover upon their pernicious ways and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; but let them look to it, there will come a day, in which all things ſhall be clearly diſcovered before God, that all the World may ſee and know them: This the Royal Prophet <hi>David</hi> underſtood, when he ſaid, <hi>Whither can I go to hide my ſelf frem thee, O Lord? or whither ſhall I fly from thy ſight? If I ſoar up to Heaven, thou art there; if I go down to Hell, there ſhall thy hand finde me out; if I take the wings of the morning, and fly from Eaſt to Weſt, thou canſt eaſily overtake me:</hi> If I ſhould hide, cover and wrap my ſelf up in nights obſcurity, the greateſt darkneſs is light to thee: He that made the hearing, and gave being to thy fight; can he want hearing and ſight? So that for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, What a terrible abomination is it to ſee, that Man onely, who is the moſt vile, wretched and invalid Worm that moves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth (except his hope of an eternal bliſs:) I ſay, that he which is the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of all creatures, ſhould dare to violate the Laws of Nature, ſeldom or never keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within compaſs, as other Creatures do,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56207:30"/> with moderation; nay further, he is ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſhameleſs, that he will aſſay to ſtand at defiance with the Great God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and riſe up in Rebellion againſt him, who when he pleaſes, can caſt him into that Bottomleſs Pit, whence there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: Who can but he aſtoniwed at thy fantaſtical pride and preſumption, O thou fragil and inconfiderate man, that thou alone of all other creatures, dareſt reſiſt thy God, who is glorified, and ever adored by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, Stars, Planets, and Elements, Angels, Beaſts and Devils; therefore be not ſo obdurate, O man.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have in the firſt Book treated of Mans condition, as he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with other Creatures; and ſhewed, he hath not onely no cauſe wherefore to wax arrogant, extol or ſet a higher eſteem of himſelf then they, but that he is in many things more uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable then they. And now having laid this ſhallow foundation, and commenced, as in a foul Copy, to draw out a Tract of his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56207:31"/> miſeries; it is convenient for proſecuting our Diſcourſe, to enter more deeply into this matter, by continuing this ſad and Tragical diſcourſe of the miſeries of the life of Man: Firſt looking upon his beginning and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal generation; and going on diſcourſing of all his ſeveral ages, and particular paſſages of his life, until we conduct him to his grave, where all troubles are ended.</p>
                  <p>And firſt let us conſider the matter of which he is engendred; Is it, think you, any thing elſe but a kinde of filthineſs and corruption? and the place of its conception, what is it but like a foul and loathſome priſon? all the time that he continues in the belly of his Mother, what is he, but like a little lump of fleſh without knowledge, or being?</p>
                  <p>After this manner is the original of mans being: When the Mother hath received and retained thoſe two different ſeeds in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which by a natural heat is compacted, there encreaſes a tender skin over the ſame, much like to that which thou ſhalt finde in an egg that is half boiled; ſo that it appears more like an egg that is addle (or like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely birth, then any other thing;) ſome few days after, the blood doth mix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56207:33"/> out a Candle before the Mother, the foul ſmoak thereof ſhould cauſe her to miſcarry, but being come to ſome Riper perfection in the Mothers Belly, do but conſider with me what delicate viands Nature hath provided for its ſuſtenance.</p>
                  <p>If the manner of the Creation of it was a wonder to us, a thing of greater admiration, will its food and means of maintenance repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our contemplation? Is it not ſtrange that it is maintained and fed with that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous blood, which the Mother ſhould purge out every Moneth, which is a ſort of Food ſo deteſtable and noiſome, that I am troubled and even aſhamed to declare it, although the Phyloſophers and Phyſitians that write con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe ſecrets of Nature do expreſs it: Thoſe that are curious and deſirous to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe things, let them read <hi>Pliny</hi>'s <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory;</hi> and there they will finde what many others have written hereof before him. But to return to our purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>After the Creature hath eaten and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it ſelf a long time with that kind of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous ſuſtenance, and is arrived to more then fitting, and to a reaſonable bulk of body, having need of more Food to maintain it, and not being able by the Navel to receive ſo much ſuſtenance as Nature requires, it turns it ſelf with a great violence to ſeek out for maintenance; and with tumbling this way and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56207:33"/> that way, it breaks all thoſe tender mantles and thin skins with which it was till then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed: But the Mother not being able to ſuffer the dangerous pangs that proceeds from this, would not willingly retain within her Body ſo troubleſome a Gueſs, ſtrives to turn it out, and opens her body as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, by which paſſage the Creature craving an Air, ſtrives to get to it, and overturns it ſelf towards the out-let of the Womb, and ſo enters into the light of this World, but not without grievous throws and pangs, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſhrieks and groans of the poor Mother, and not without danger, toil, and ſome hurt to the tender body of the Infants; and in the time of the nine Moneths what griefs, what anguiſhes, and ſorrowes do many Mothers feel? which the Creature cauſeth, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any long ſtories of many Women, who being with Child looſe their ſtomacks, and cannot eat or digeſt their food, but are poſſeſſed with divers ſtrange appetites and longings, ſome of which (for Example) have deſired to eat humane Fleſh, coveting to eat the meat out of their Husbands mouths, and the like; which many times hath cauſed men to flie, and abſent themſelves from home.</p>
                  <p>Many Hiſtories are full of Example of this Nature; others again, are extream deſirous to feed upon Aſhes, Coals, Cinders, and the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56207:34"/> like; according to the quantity of ill and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Humours which are predominant in their bodies.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, with what pangs and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures many times are the ſad Mothers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed? And in what hazard do they ſee themſelves when they come to the bringing forth of the Infants. Some come with their Armes for moſt, others with their Feet, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with their Knees, and others come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, or double: But what is worſe and moſt ſad and woful, is a thing which cannot well be expreſſed without terror both to the Speaker, (or Writer) and the Hearer; which is, That ſometimes there is a neceſſity to ſend for Phyſitians and Chirurgeons inſtead of Midwives, to tair, diſmember, and cut in pieces the Creatures, to get them out of the Mothers body to ſave her life; and too often its of neceſſity to cut up and anotomize the poor innocent Mother with ſeveral inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to beat and ſtir the body to get out the tender Fruit: Some Humane Creatures are born ſougly, and prodigiouſly unſhapen, that they ſeem rather to be abominable Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters then Men, others are produced with two Heads and four Leggs, as one was ſo born in <hi>Paris</hi> at the time the learned Author was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this Treatiſe. Some Twins have been brought forth that have cleaved, and been joyned together, as it was ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> two
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56207:34"/> Females joyned faſt to each other by the Shoulders, one of the which (after they had lived together ſome time) died, and after made a putrifaction in the other, and cauſed its death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polidorus</hi> writes, That little before <hi>Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> went and joyned Forces with <hi>Marcello,</hi> there was a Woman delivered of a Child with a Head like an Elephant, and another was born with four feet like a Beaſt.</p>
                  <p>The Modern Hiſtorians write to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That in the Year one thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighteen, a <hi>Roman</hi> Curtezan was delivered of a Creature, one half like a Dog and the other half like a Man.</p>
                  <p>All that have undertaken to write the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of the <hi>Indies,</hi> do affirm; That there are at this day many that bear the ſhape of half Men and half Beaſts, occaſioned by that hateful, bruitiſh, beaſtiality, that raigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe people, who take delight in committing ſuch execrable Vices: Others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain are born Blinde, Deaf, Dumb, Maimed, Lame, and ſome wanting a Member; for which the Relations are ſorry, the Mothers ill ſpoken of, and the Fathers aſhamed; ſo that if we do but with attention conſider the many and ſad caſualties and miſeries that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Births, we ſhall finde the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb to be very true, <hi>That our Mothers do conceive us in filthy loathſomneſs, bring us forth</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:56207:35"/> 
                     <hi>in grief and ſorrow, and do nouriſh and educate us with great pains and care.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt Scene, or Act, in the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy of our Humane Life: Here you have ſeen what Government and Order it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerves, being encloſed in the Priſon of the Mothers Womb. Now let us contemplate a little.</p>
                  <p>What can man be compared to after he is gotten out of this cloſe Priſon, and put upon firm ground? Truly I can fancy him like no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much as a Worm that creeps out of a Dung-hill: Oh what a gentle habit he brings to make his firſt entrance into the World; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to cover this ſtately Fabrick, and to grace his pompuous entrance; what neceſſary Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment think ye doth he bring with him? no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but the filth and blood, with which he comes covered and bathed all over, which is nothing elſe but a lively repreſentation to us of that Original ſin with which the Child is beſpotted, as holy Scripture teaches us: O ſad and weighty neceſſity; O miſerable and deplorable condition: O what a ſorrowful and pitiful ſhame is this, that before this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſinned, or is in a capacity actually to offend, that it ſhould be bound with the ſhame of Original corruption, and be a bond-ſlave to Satan, and be ſubject to evil before it knowes how to do ill. All this proceeds from that Fruit which was ſo fair to the Eye, ſweet
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56207:35"/> to the taſte, but bitter in effect to our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: Or from that cluſter of bitter Grapes which the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of, That the Fathers have eaten bitter Grapes and the Childrens teeth are ſet on edge; <hi>A bitter Fruit indeed!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What is the firſt muſical note that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes at his firſt coming into the World? What are they but cries, tears, ſighs, ſobs, and groans, which are certain Meſſengers, Diſcoverers, and Fore-tellers of the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which afterwards he is to undergoe, the which he not being able to expreſs in words, endeavours to put us in minde of them with weeping tears.</p>
                  <p>All the Emperors, Monarchs, Princes, and great Lords which commands the World, and turns it upſide down at their pleaſures; theſe at their birth ſing the ſame Song, are ſubject to the ſame frail condition.</p>
                  <p>The leaſt Creature that Nature produces, ſo ſoon as they be born begin to creep about, and ſeek out for proviſions and neceſſaries to maintain life. The Chicken ſo ſoon as it gets out of the ſhell, findes it ſelf free of that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, there's no ſuch need of waſhing and cleanſing as there is of man, it preſently runs after the Hen, underſtands when ſhe calls, and begins to pick and eat, it flies, and fears the Kite, although it never received nor ſaw any hurt by him, but meerly by inſtinct of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56207:36"/> it knowes to avoid danger; now do but conſider and contemplate man when he is firſt born, and he will appear to be like a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous lump of Fleſh, which many other Creatures might eaſily devour, he not having any ſtrength or power to move or defend himſelf, he would die with hunger, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to take the Breaſt, but would as ſoon ſuck a ſweetned poyſonous potion as that, and would as ſoon take red fire hot Iron in his hand as any eatable thing, not being of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to know good from evil: If thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him in the Cradle, there will he neſtle in his own Dung, and batten in his own Urine, not being able to caſt thoſe Natural excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from him, nor cleanſe himſelf, as the leaſt of all other animals can do.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the ſweets and odiferous ſcents, with which Nature doth perfume man, with ſuch ſort of ſtuffe doth ſhe perfume and adorn this little room, wherein is contained ſo much preſumption and haughtineſs of ſpirit, that he eſteems himſelf to be ſo valiant and ſtrong, as if he deſerved to be Lord of all the other Creatures, when many of them are more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and ſtronger then he: But let's trace his farther progreſs.</p>
                  <p>After he is lanched forth into this Gulf of miſeries and ſorrowes, how its needful to ſuckle him, and give him Food to maintain life? for if they do not give it him he knowes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56207:36"/> not where to finde it. This care is to be the Mothers; for this reaſon Nature hath given them 2 Breaſts like two ſmall round Gourds, proper places and fit, to contain the Milk for the ſuſtenance of their Children; but how many Mothers are there at this day, (if the truth were ſpoken) who are contented and think they have done too much for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by bringing them forth onely, and that many times Abortives, and ouſt out from their Entrails, and are preſently ſent out to ſome Village to be nurſed, without either ſeeing or hearing of them at all, for which cauſe there is many times a poor Child ſent them inſtead of their own. Such Women do rather take pleaſure and contentment in a Foiſting-hound or Lap-dog, and with much more ſhameleſs delight do they kiſs, hugge, and embrace it, then if it were their own natural Child, which they count a ſhame to feed, cleanſe, ſwathe, or take into their armes.</p>
                  <p>Moſt part of the other animals do not uſe this practice, nor are ſo unnatural to their young ones; they never commit them to any other, although they have never ſo many, but are a continual ſhield of defence and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, for they will not forſake them until they ſee them of ſufficient ſtrength and capacity to guide for the preſent, and defend themſelves from danger: And which is more ſtrange, there is often ſtrifes, debates, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56207:37"/> emulacions betwixt the Males and Females which ſhall do moſt for them: The truth of which hath not onely been experimentally demonſtrated in the Apes, but more in the Beares, a ſort of cruel, fierce, and ravenous Beaſts, which love their young ones ſo much, that they doe not onely content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with cockering and giving them the teats, but ſeeing that they are caſt out without any form or ſhape, they labour with a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome toil, continually licking them until they have brought them to a Natural figure or likeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the Birds, although they have many times 5, 6, or a dozen under their Wings, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs no Gainers of Corn, yield no Milk, nor have any ſtore laid up to feed them, yet they never leave nor forſake them, but finde out new wayes, force ſtrength out of weakneſs, and act as far as nature hath taught them, that they may comply with Natures obligation, and hatch and bring up their young ones: But where can we finde a better or more ſollide reaſon of humane miſery? then this, That the poor Wretch is no ſooner born, but he is deprived of that which of juſt right doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, and Nature hath provided for him: He is forced to ſuck the Milk of a ſtrange perſon; and often, if it be a cheap Nurſe, they do not look whether ſhe be croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, maimed, or lame, or whether ſhe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56207:37"/> with any foul vice or infirmity, either in body or condition, from the which they receive ſo much prejudice and hurt, that it were far better they ſhould be brought up in the Deſart, then come into the hands of ſuch Nurſes? and if it were onely the body that received this damage, it would not behalf ſo bad; it's not that onely that's intereſted, ſpoiled, and hindered, as formerly it was ſeen in <hi>Titus</hi> the Son of <hi>Veſpatian</hi> the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, and many others, who being brought up and ſuckled by an infirm Nurſe, paſſed the few dayes of his life in a weak, ſickly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate condition, as <hi>Lapriadus</hi> writes.</p>
                  <p>But all this is nothing in compariſon of the detriment and prejudice the Soul receives from that evil Character which is ſtamped therein, by the lewd breeding and the wicked life of the Nurſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dion</hi> a <hi>Greek Hiſtorian,</hi> in the life of <hi>Cayus Caligula</hi> the third Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> writes, That they did not impute to his Parents the wicked, infamous, and miſchievous Nature of this lewd and blood-thirſty Emperor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was certainly known he had ſuckt it with the Milk: For the Nurſe that gave him ſuck was of a wicked and cruel diſpoſition by nature, and had a cuſtome to dip her Niple in blood, and then give the Child the Teat; from which he commenced to be ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and appetitious glutton as to eat
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56207:38"/> mens blood; for afterwards he not ſatisfying himſelf with continual Deaths, Woundings, and Wicked Actions, which he committed, but would ſuck and lick the Swords and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with which he had ſlain men. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</p>
                  <p>Not being able to ſatisfie his wicked appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite with humane blood, he wiſhed, That there were no more Heads in the World but one, that he might take it off, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remain abſolute Lord of the whole World.</p>

This is not from the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56207:38"/> Milk it ſucks, but from a continual converſe and cuſtome the Child takes looking upon his Nurſe, and if ſhe be given to much drinking, makes it of a faint and feeble complexion, and cauſes it to love Wine and ſtrong drink, as we read in the life of the Emperor <hi>Tiberio,</hi> who was much given to this Vice; for the Nurſe that gave him ſuck did not onely drink to exceſs her ſelf, but often fed him with ſops in Wine.</p>

                  <p>Man (ſayes he) that is born of a Woman, or the Son of a Woman: It may be theſe laſt Words may appear to be ſuperfluous, and that they were not fitly placed; but truly they are wiſely ſet down, and very ſignificant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do point at the frail <hi>principium</hi> of this proud Creature Man, for why? he is born of a Woman, and amongſt all the Creatures that God made, there is none ſo ſubject to miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and infirmities as they are, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that are moſt fruitful: They ſeldome have a months quiet throughout the year, and that not without fears, terrours, cares, and continual tremblings.</p>

                     <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and other ancient Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, murmured againſt Nature, becauſe ſhe had given ſo large lives to the Harts, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and other animals, which ſerve for lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this World, and Man which is Emperor and King of all the Creatures, and abſolute Lord over them, his is but ſhort and brief, though he have honourable and caeleſtial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments here; and what is worſe, ſhe clips and cuts from this ſhort life which is beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, a great part with Sleeps, Dreames, Angers, Cares, Troubles, Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and other misfortunes, which attend, moleſt, and abreviate this ſhort life, theſe our few dayes; and if we ſhould well caſt up and conſider the pains, labours, and troubles we undergo, the many anguiſhes and cares thereof, and how they waſte us and haſten us to our ends, we ſhall finde that few are the dayes of our ſorrowful Pilgrimage here, which brings us to the compariſon of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet makes of man with the ſhade.</p>
                  <p>What (ſayes he) is the ſhadow, but onely an appearance which deceives the ſight of man, a fancy, a figure without being or ſubſtance, the which ſometimes appears grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſometimes leſſer, even ſo is man, which ſometimes ſeems to be ſomething, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

                  <p>Let us now conſider and contemplate him being grown bigger and of a more comely ſtature, and ſee whether his miſeries and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes have end here.</p>
                  <p>Verily, (if we will be impartial Judges) we ſhall finde that his calamities and labours do not onely terminate, but that he falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and launcheth forth into a more ſpacious Sea of Dangers and Afflictions: For by this time Nature hath provided for him a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Combats and Aſſaults, ſtronger and more fiercer then the former; his blood begins to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56207:43"/> boil, the Fleſh allures and invites with her delights, ſenſuallity ſhews the way how to put them in practice, the World and the Devil tempt and beguile the diſordered Appetite of his Youth, with inviting to him ſuch dreſt and well prepared delicates, that it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he who is aſſaulted, ſurrounded, and ſtormed with ſo ſtrong and ſo many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but that he ſhould be conquered, if he receive not ſuccour from ſome good and friendly Angel, by the particular Grace and Favour of God; for in that body which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes Riches, Liberty, and Youth without reſtraint, ſo generally lodge, dwell, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit all ſorts of Vice in the World.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Marcus Ancilius</hi> ſaid, I am not in charity with our Step-mother Nature, who ſeems not to have ſatisfied her revenge upon poor man at his beginning, and his being unnaturally fed with the Milk of a ſtrange Breaſt, but ſtrives farther to load him with all ſorrows ſhe can: Now he muſt alſo learn his Trade, Occupation, or Science, from a ſtrange hand, for which cauſe ſhe produces few <hi>Catoes,</hi> who will take care to teach their own Children; but rather ſhe tauſes Fathers now a dayes to diſdain and count it an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing to do it, and ſo leave them to taſte of the bitter Potion of cruel and neglective School-maſters, which often diſcourages them

                     <p>But after he hath paſſed by an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of evils, and attained to the age of ſeven

                     <p>Thence in few years his face begins to be covered with Hair, a Beard adorns his Chin, and he comences to right Man, with which his cares and troubles doubly encreaſe, and he enters into a Stage where he meets with new afflictions and vexations: He muſt goe forth into publick to ſeek company and go in Society, which is like a Touch-ſtone to try the purity of his inclination to good or evil. If he be deſcended of a Noble houſe, of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and Illuſtrious Family, or if he be an ordinary Gentleman, that he may maintain his Honour, and follow the foot-ſteps of his predeceſſors and imitate his ſuperiours, he muſt ſeek out many inventions, provide rich and convenient accouterments, be hardy in Battle, and underſtand ſtratagems and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of War, expoſe himſelf to a thouſand dangers and hazards, lay his life at ſtake upon all occaſions, ſpend his blood prodigally and

                     <p>If he ſtrive never ſo much to imploy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Calling, yet very often though he labour and travel, and do his uttermoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to releive his neceſſity, he cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to what is requiſite for him.</p>
                     <p>Then not without cauſe did <hi>Marcus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the ſeventeenth <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition of Humanity, complain, who was wont to ſay; <hi>Many times have I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated within my ſelf, if there ever were now, or could be found, any Eſtate, Degree, Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Land, Countrey, Kingdome, or Age, in the which there hath lived a Man that hath not in his life taſted what thing is adverſe Fortune; that hath not met with Croſſes and Afflictions:</hi> And if there could be diſcovered ſuch a one, I believe he muſt be ſome abominable Monſter,

                     <p>To be brief, I finde that he that yeſterday was rich, to day becomes poor, he that yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day was in health, to day is viſited with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he that yeſterday was in jollity, laughing, to day I ſee him weeping, he that yeſterday was in proſperity and eſteem, to day I ſee him deſpiſed and in adverſity, and he that ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday was alive, to day I ſee him dead and in his Grave.</p>
                     <p>But now lets return to our commenced pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and lets ſearch more particularly into things.</p>
                     <p>Shew me that man that hath moſt deſired, obtained a condition, and that more ſuitable to his wiſhes and contentments, then any other manner of living, that hath not at laſt grown weary, deſpiſed and complained of his ſad hope, repented and been ſorry that he had ſpent ſo much pretious time in proceeding in it.</p>
                     <p>To ſee this more cleerly, lets conſider ſome principal degrees of men in the World, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſuch as ſaile upon the waters moſt part of their lives, ſwiming like fiſhes, which are Mariners, to how many dangers are they ſubject night and day, what a houſe do they enjoy, what thing is there dwelling but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual filthy priſon; what cloaths do they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56207:49"/> wear, but of Cloth like a ſpunge, fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to receive filth and water, they go like voluntary Vagabons, and are in a ſeeming and perpetual exile; they have ſeldome any repoſe, they are encompaſſed with bluſtring Windes on all ſides, they have but ſmall guard from the Waters, Tempeſts, Hailes, and Snowes, and are ſubject to Pirates and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to Rocks, Shelves, Sands, and ſurging Sulkes of the ſuperbious Sea, and ever in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of drowning, and being interred in the bellies of Fiſhes, which being ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by that famous Greek Phyloſopher <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> who doubted whether ſuch people were to be accounted amongſt the Earthly Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or thoſe that live on the Water; or whether they were to be accounted amongſt the living or the dead.</p>
                     <p>And another Phyloſopher called <hi>Anachar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> ſaid; That there was not above two or three Fingers betwixt them and Death, that is as the planks are in thickneſs, this life appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſo deteſtable.</p>
                     <p>Peradventure thou wilt think to find more quietneſs in that of a Husbandman, and that there is leſs troubles in a Countrey life; thou wilt be apt to queſtion, whether a Ruſtick life be not better, and give the anſwer thy ſelf that it is, becauſe it is more eaſie, more quiet, ſweet, and more pleaſant, eſpecially know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56207:49"/> that moſt of the Patriarches and Prophets made choice of this manner of living, being the moſt ſweetly quiet, without prejudice or guile to any, the moſt plain and ſincere, free from the difficult Catches, Traps, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moils of Traffick.</p>
                     <p>Alſo many of the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors left their Royal commands and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, forſook their Palaces, their Capatals, Triumphant Arches, Amphitheators, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and many other Magnificent Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to withdraw and retire themſelves into the Countrey, to prune and graft the Trees with their own hands, to plant Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſow Seeds in the Gardens, as did <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian, Attalus, Cyrus, Beroaldus, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> one of the <hi>Caeſars,</hi> and many others, which <hi>Columellia</hi> and other Hiſtorians doe make mention of.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe that would attentively conſider and ruminate upon theſe things, ſhall find un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Garments there are many Thorns, there are more prickles then Roſes among theſe ſeeming ſweets; thou wilt not deny the truth hereof, do but ſeriouſly mark with me.</p>
                     <p>Almighty God catching Man out of the Earthy-paradice, for a chaſtiſement (beſides his baniſhment) ſends him to till the Earth, telling him withal, <hi>Curſed ſhall be the ground for</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56207:50"/> the Family complaining for want of Food; in concluſion, this life is no other thing but a Mortal Wound, that hath its Root or <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium</hi> deep within, and keeps the miſerable patient in continual pain and ſorrow: Even ſo is the poor Husbandman ſeldome content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but now he torments himſelf of one ſide, then on the other.</p>
                     <p>If there falls much Rain, he ſayes, I never ſaw ſuch Floods and Waters: If Rain be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, I never ſaw ſuch a Drought. Then he complains the Locuſts is in his Grain, or Stormes, or Whirl-Windes, have blaſted his Corn in the Field, his Trees in the Orchard. But above all they do complain of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when they are in Field, for from them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds many evils to them.</p>
                     <p>In the following lamentation which was lately preſented to me by a friend and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is Entituled, <hi>Give peace in our time O Lord,</hi> of which Sentence the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is a gloſs, <hi>Da pacem Domine in diebus noſtris, quia non eſt alius qui pugnet pro nobis, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi tu Deus noſter;</hi> Give peace in her time, O Lord, becauſe there is none other that fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for us but onely thou O God; which is a godly and learned expreſſion in the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                        <hi>nor Goods, which I can ſay I have received from any but from thee, to thee a General of all Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who alone without danger canſt defeat and reſiſt them: I pray thee to avenge me, and chaſtiſe them, give peace to all, we have great need of peace: But if thou wilt chaſtiſe men, as thou haſt juſt cauſe, and thou onely canſt do it, O Lord.</hi> Our fore-fathers although they lived in this World, they never ſaw the Villanies acted which we ſee <hi>in diebus noſtris,</hi> in our dayes. With great care, trouble, and ſweat, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, yet am ready to die with hunger, it's three dayes ſince a piece of Bread hath been eaten in my houſe, <hi>(quia non eſt)</hi> becauſe there is none: I ſowed, planted, manured, and gathered, I ploughed all my Land, both Waſte and paſture to maintain my houſe and family, but wo is me they have deſtroyed all. It was not one alone that did this evil, God thou knoweſt how many they are, and how many afflictions daily lie upon me, as well A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Debt, which by reaſon of loſſes, I cannot pay, as theſe Souldiers which do tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and trouble me. <hi>(Alias qui pugnet)</hi> Who ſhall we ſeek to defend us but thee: We peaſants have cauſe to complain, becauſe they that ſhould fight <hi>pro nobis,</hi> for us, do abuſe, afflict, and deſtroy us: O my Creator, what a comfort is it, conſidering thy infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that from the evils which I ſuffer none can

                     <p>But let's leave the poor Husbandmen to their cares, troubles, and labours, and let's proceed forward to ſee what are the paſſages, what ſweets may be found amongſt Trafficks of Merchandizes and Traders.</p>
                     <p>If we behold onely its outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it will ſeem to be free of all afflictions and miſeries, becauſe it is coloured over with the ſplendid Flouriſh of Riches, and other painted arts which they uſe, they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but cannot afford us any contentment, any ſollid repoſe, or quiet enjoyment, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that which <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, That Trade was firſt invented, becauſe it was found to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to humane life and ſociety, and that many of the ancient wiſe men were Merchants, as <hi>Tales, Mileſſius, Solon, Hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> and many others, and was the firſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ingendering love betwixt different Nations, and enterchanging mutual amity and peace amongſt bordering Princes; for they carry or tranſport from one Countrey to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from one City to another, what is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56207:52"/> or what abounds: Yet we cannot ſo far mark, ſo artificially guild over this kinde of living, though he carry it out never ſo high, and diſſemble it never ſo gallantly; you may read in their Eyes, conjecture by their Faces. The diſquiets, troubles, and perplexities which attend Merchants, to what and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrange hazards are they ſubject to every moment, both by Sea and Land; beſides the mention we might particularly make, how the greateſt part of their life they go like Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Vagabons from Countrey to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, from Town to City, from City to Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, that they ſeem to be like Gipſies or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Offenders; onely it's true, their part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their Country and Friends is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; they never do other, but run, go, trot, nay, flie both by Sea and Land, meeting with colds, heats, paſſing as it were through fires, waters, and ſnowes, being onely encouraged and ſpurred on by a diſordered covetouſneſs to get and purchaſe Wealth, they rejoyce to looſe that contentment and ſweet repoſe which they might enjoy at their own homes with their poſſeſſions, their Wives, Children, and Servants about them, and put their lives in danger by the deceitful, lurking, ambuſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſtratagems of Thieves, who ever have an eye to them and their wayes that they may rob and ſpoil them, yet all this is forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56207:52"/> and masked over by their diſordinate and covetous appetites and deſires, which doth continually boil in their Hearts and reign in their affections.</p>
                     <p>Now let's ſpeak a little farther of them, and begin with the principal peices of their Harneſs, which are falſe Oaths, cheating their Neighbours, and delayes, theſe are the grand relicks of their holy ſociety; for it's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to enrich themſelves ſo much and ſo ſoon, as too many do, without prejudice of other men.</p>
                     <p>They alwayes have the old ſaying in their mouths when they ſell too dear, that they do it to keep themſelves from poverty, from an empty belly, to keep themſelves from miſery and trouble; they need no other thing but to turn their backs upon God a year or two, and largely to expreſs with their mouths what they deny in their Conſciences, and ſo ever to remain rich Aſſes.</p>
                     <p>How different and how many evils may we add to this, of which they are the cauſes, by reaſon of corrupted and falſe Commodities from ſtrange Countries.</p>
                     <p>The ſmall Wares and Fooleries they bring over, which are not neceſſary for uſe of Men, but prejudicial to Commonwealths, for they are good for nothing but to viſiate the fancies of Women, Gallants, and Children, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56207:53"/> helps to maintain exceſs of pomp, vice, and expence, as if our evil inclinations were not ſufficient to draw us into wicked Courſes, without provocations.</p>
                     <p>With theſe and the like finical (but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable) Commodities, do they robbe, ſpoil, and leave deſtitute of money, moſt Countries and Provinces, leaving behinde them inſtead thereof Childiſh Toyes, and pedling trifles of little value, and the worſt is they come home ill principled, with looſe living, and teach the vices and bad cuſtomes and ſuperfluities which they have learned abroad, and bring with them their improved Merchandizes.</p>
                     <p>They alſo have their Counſels, Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and Conſultations, and deputed places for them in every Mart, City, which we call Exchange, and has a different denomination, according to the Language of every Country; for in every one they have theſe publick pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether moſt commonly do reſort the Richeſt and moſt Credible, reſolving if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to work and wear out of Trade young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners, and ſuch have ſmall ſtocks, that they might drive it themſelves, to whom they will it may be ſell a parcel of Goods by the Great, that they might cheat others by Retail; and it were well there were no worſe evil coucht under the covert of Trade; for ſince Princes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56207:53"/> of theſe latter Times became neceſſiated, by reaſon of their exceſſive expences and vanities. And theſe Merchants are continually with full Caſhes, they never want acquaintance and entertainment in the Palaces of Kings and Princes, by which means they come to know and converſe with forreign Princes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them of their own Countries Affairs, lend them Moneys, and thereby commit Treaſon againſt their own Natural Kings, and betray their own Countries and Cities, as it hath been ſeen by ſad experience in <hi>France,</hi> not many years ſince, with great damage to their Countrey, deſolation to their Towns, and deſtruction to their people.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our purpoſe, and treat of Shop-keepers, which in ſeveral other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are called Merchants.</p>
                     <p>I ſhal forbear to mention a thouſand known Cheats, Arts, and Cozenages, with which they know to ſophiſticate and corrupt almoſt all ſorts of Commodities which are neceſſary for the life of Man.</p>
                     <p>This is the principal peice of their Art and Cunning, and this they teach to their Servants and Children before they will put them in truſt with their Shops and Wares: This is the Doctrine they teach to them in their Youth, they encourage thoſe moſt that under fair words can beſt couch a perjury, and ſell their
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56207:54"/> breath at a better price then their Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, like the cunning <hi>Genoves,</hi> and <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> the ſubtil <hi>Venetian,</hi> and crafty <hi>Toledano.</hi> And for the Worlds wickedneſs, we may ſee things ſo far out of order at this day in this kinde, that if thou goeſt out of a Shop, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving agreed the price of any Commodity, not paying for it, or taking it with ye, and preſently returneſt for it again, thou wilt finde it trucked and changed by the hands of young Thieves the Servants, who to obey their Maſters will, and make them rich, are willing to take a turn in Hell, and pawn their Souls to the Devil.</p>
                     <p>There is another kinde, or ſort of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of which hitherto I have not ſpoken; who fill their Shops with Commodities, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed (with good ſecurity) from thoſe of their own profeſſion; and under pretence of a great whole-ſale Trade, buy upon truſt great quantities of Merchandizes, and make plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhew meerly to cheat their Creditors, and after they have gotten into cuſtody much Goods and Money, turn Banckrupts, and take as the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſayes <hi>(Calcarem villa Diego.)</hi> All they can get together, and run into ſtrange Countries, and there live in as Noble and Triumphant equipage at their own coſt, with the Wealth they have robbed and pillaged from other miſerable and afflicted men, who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56207:54"/> often remain ſo poor and deſperate, that they are ready to kill and deſtroy themſelves, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt by Cheat that which they thought had been as ſafe as in their own hands.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> underſtanding ſuch like Cheats and Abuſes to proceed from Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they would never permit they ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inhabit, ſet up Shop, or dwell amongſt their Citizens, or within their Walls; but they allotted them places diſtant from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there to build Ware-houſes and Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and have their Traffick.</p>
                     <p>Anciently there were many Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths that would never permit them to bear any publick Offices amongſt them, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their Senates, or Counſels: Alſo they have been ſharply reproved of many of the Doctors of the Church in ſeveral occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and paſſages of their Books, for their vile way of livelihood and dealing.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56207:55"/> under which they ſubject their Necks; how they are led as in amaze, they go to the Wars, who live in Martial imployments, the which kinde of living is ſo bitter and hard, that even the bruit Beaſts do abhor it, for they have Caves and Dens, wherein to take their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repoſe at their times, but the poor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who ſeldome ſleep, hath no other Inn but the broad Field, no other Bed but the bare ground, no other Canopy but the Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Firmament, being ſubject to bitter cold Froſts, cruel Stormes and Tempeſts, Raines and Snows, is forced to ſuffer Cold and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Heat, and Thirſt: When he hears an Alarum he muſt reſolve with himſelf to kill, or be kill'd, to be over-come, or rout, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome his Enemies, which is his Brother and his Neighbour; and for three or four Crownes a Moneth, he ſets himſelf as a mark for Canon and Musket; ſo that the miſery of a Souldiers life, is greater then any other: Hearken courteous Reader, if thou wilt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what a horrible and abominable Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter War is.</p>
                     <p>Haſte thou ever ſeen a Battle betwixt a Woolf and a Bear, or the combat of any other cruel Animals? What howlings, what tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other, and what ſtrange cruelty is it to ſee the bruit Creatures, ſpoil, pull mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls out of each others Limbs, without any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56207:55"/> favour? How much more abominable thing is it, to ſee a man pale, furious, and almoſt transformed into a bruit Beaſt, ſet upon, hack, and hew, and ſtrive to deſtroy his Neighbour, or of this kinde; ſpend his uttermoſt rage and fury againſt him, without making account of many other evils and cruelties which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thereon.</p>
                     <p>The ſimple people travel and labour to build, beautifie, and ſurround, with ſtately Walls, famous Cities, and Towns, which they do maintain and enrich with their ſweat and labour, fortifie and ſtrengthen with their diligence and care; and all this without any diſturbances, jealouſies, or feares of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
                     <p>What an affliction muſt it be to ſee all their labours in their own view caſt down, laid waſte, made deſolate, and that in a moment, which was many years raiſing, building, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, and preſerving, by the indulgent care of the founders and wiſe ſucceſſors: Nay, after that their Flocks and Heards taken from them, their Bread like untimely Fruit, or the blaſted buds of the Vine, devoured they know not how, their Peaſants deſtroyed, their Towns and Villages burnt and conſumed by the hands of theſe devourers.</p>
                     <p>There is no houſe nor family (where War is) in which they do not bewail and lament a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56207:56"/> loſs. All Trades and Offices firſt grow cold, and after Wars rigour, are laid aſide, and the poor diſtreſſed people muſt either faſt, or run deſperate courſes, to ſeek a livelihood, and to preſerve life: Their Virgins are deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, their chaſte Matrons remain barren and hid in ſecret places, their Lawes are ſilent and dead, or of none effect, Humanity amongſt men dies, or at leaſt is a Stranger, Religion is polluted and corrupted holy Churches vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated and prophaned, old men led Captives, and before their Eyes they ſee Mothers kill their own Children; Youth dejects Parents and runs into all manner of evils: You ſhall finde thouſands of Widdows, and twice as many Orphans, which makes the people hate King, Princes, and Governours, by reaſon of the many afflictions and impoſitions which War brings upon them: There is nothing but Rancours, Hatreds, and Curſes: They muſt learn to entertain Strangers, Game, and procure them for Friends, make great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and proviſions for War, as well by Sea as by Land; they muſt ſtrengthen their Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, make Re-doubts, provide Engines, as Piſtols, Muskets, Accabuſs, Granadoes, and Cannon-ſhot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cleanſe Motes and Ditches, ſtand Centinels, and many other things acquired for defence and offence!</p>
                     <p>What a ſad misfortune is this of ours? that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56207:56"/> Nature ſhould not be contented to produce Man to ſo much frailty, and ſubject to ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny infirmities, but that it muſt admit of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious War to break in upon him, which is ſuch a ſtrange, contagious, peſtilential, and pernicious evil, that it contains all other evils and wickedneſſes in the World, and drawing them after it, muſt needs be the greateſt of all: It's ſuch a deſtoying evil, that it doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflict the bad, but delights in nothing more then when it perſecutes Innocents and Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                     <p>If this Deviliſh madneſs and fury were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt Turkes and Infidels, or other ſtrange people, it might ſeem to be ſomething tollerable; ſuch victories and ſpoiles might give us ſome content: But Oh, our God, when to the contrary Chriſtian Princes do act theſe things againſt each other! Wouldeſt thou know what are their Spoiles, Trophies, and Victories of War? What is their Glory and Magnificence? And with what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to eſtabliſh to them and theirs, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Empire with peace and quiet.</p>
                     <p>I will tell thee the greateſt that can come to them.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt Glory and Victory they can pretend, is, deſtroy, afflict, and torment their Neighbour, their Brother a Chriſtian, their Riches, is to ſee their bordering Prince
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56207:57"/> poor and low, his tears are their laughter, and for the moſt part their Victories are ſo bloody and ſad, that both Conquerer and Conquered, have little cauſe to rejoyce; for there never was any Battle of conſequence, wherein the Conqueror came off ſo to his wiſh, as that he had not cauſe to complain of his loſs, and be ſorrowful for the blood that had been ſhed, in which he could not but ſhew ſome humanity.</p>
                     <p>As the Hiſtorians do relate of that great Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who entring into <hi>Rome</hi> with great Pomp and State, with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs they were wont to give for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſuch as had gained great Victories, and ſubjected new Provinces to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; being drawn in a ſtately Chariot, in the midſt of his Glories remembring the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he had committed againſt his Neighbour, with an audible Voice cried out: What greater Vanity can an Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit then this? that for having conquered many ſtrong Cities, Towns, and Countries, diſturbed the peace and quiet of men, burnt and deſtroyed Cities and ſtrong Garriſons, undone honeſt, poor men, enriched Tyrants, and cauſed to be an infinite number of Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and Orphans; that in recompence of ſo many evils and detriments to Man-kinde, he ſhould content to receive with ſo great

                     <p>Is it poſſible that we that were brought up in the School of Chriſtianity, and enlightned with the Grace of that Divine, illuminating Spirit, that we ſhould not fear that at the day of judgement, this Pagan-Emperor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, ſhould riſe up againſt us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, and ſtrongly alleadge againſt us how little we make of the life of a Man, much leſs of a Chriſtian, whoſe brotherly life ought to be more precious in our ſight.</p>
                     <p>How many yeares hath that part of the World which we call <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and troubled by Wars; ſo that ye

                     <p>Men are grown ſo diſſolute, blinde, and indiſcreet, that without reſpect to Sex or Age, they kill, deſtroy, and cut off the one and the other, as if they willed if poſſible to conſume even Nature it ſelf: So that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

                     <p>Is it poſſible that Chriſtians ſhould not have ſo much compaſſion of their Brethren? as the fierce and bruit Beaſts have of one another, who ſeldome do hurt thoſe of their own kinde.</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56207:59"/> is not onely more dangerous then any other kinde of Armes or Engine of War in the World, but is more to be feared then poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; although the very Thunder, Lightning, from Heaven, the which is forged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the four Elements be ſo powerful and quick, yet this may in ſome meaſure be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to it, and when it comes to the utmoſt of its drineſs, and when the fire takes hold of the Salt, or ſulphrous ſubſtance it multiplies and converts into fire and air.</p>

                     <p>Now we have declared the paſſages of War: What miſerable lives they lead, and what reward they get, who hazard their lives and take great pains therein, and how it is in all reſpects, and all its effects a farther procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of Mans affliction and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Now let's contemplate the life of Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, how they live that are in the Palaces of Kings, Princes, and great Lords, And to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with thoſe that are near about the perſons of Kings, &amp;c. in what they place their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt felicity. Let's make proof of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>They think there is no greater happineſs in this life then the gracious Aſpect of a Prince: What greater favour then to ſee him, talk with him, and accompany him when they will? What contentment may be compared to the Favours, Treatments, and Advancements, which Kings and great Lords beſtow on their Favourites? What greater honour then to introduce a friend, or ſtranger, to the Kings preſence? continually to enjoy his company, his embraces, delights, and love; with other Courtly pleaſures.</p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:56207:60"/>
                     <p> There are ſome ſo flie and cunning, that are alwayes watching, that they may not let paſs a good opportunity of preferment for their own advantage; others are in hopes to fill themſelves both Corps and Purſes, and at laſt are forced to caſt up all again.</p>
                     <p>Some exerciſe their Wits to invent Taxes, Loans, and Exciſes, to gather together great Treaſures, encreaſe the Revenues of their Princes, and line their own Bags with the ſpoils of the people.</p>
                     <p>With ſuch men many times Princes deal, as we uſe to do with Cattle; we let them fatten and grow groſs, that afterwards we may feaſt our ſelves and friends upon them: So do Princes ſuffer theſe men to grow rich and fill their Coffers with money, that they may take it all from them at once, and place others in their rooms, though they have been never ſo truſty.</p>
                     <p>Do but behold how theſe miſerable Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers do ſell their liberties to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves! They muſt, though againſt their wills, do what their Princes commands them, be it right, or wrong, juſt, or unjuſt: They muſt ſtrive to laugh when they laugh, weep when they weep, approve what they approve of, and condemn what they condemn: They muſt ſet themſelves to act what ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and execute what ſhall be commanded
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56207:61"/> them; even change and alter their Natural cuſtomes and conditions: With the ſevere they muſt be ſevere, with the ſad they muſt be ſad, and in a manner transform their own lives, beings, and Natures, to pleaſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and content them, if they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to what they deſire, and not be caſt out of favour. If their Prince be vicious, ſo muſt they be; if cruel, their meſſages muſt be to ſhed blood: And though many times the Favourite endeavours to conform to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of his Maſter, and appear like him in his Natural inclinations.</p>
                     <p>Often it happens that for one fault commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, one diſcontent, or one neglect, in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his humour, he turns him off, and makes him loſe the Fruits of all the Services he ever did him in his life, which we ſhall finde veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Favourites of the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi> whoſe condition was ſuch, that after many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and rewards received, and being raiſed to the higheſt patch of Dignities and Honors, for any trivial fault or diſcontent, they were not onely deprived of their Wealth and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours received, but were declared Capital Enemies to the Emperor; which being well conſidered and underſtood by Divine <hi>Plato,</hi> who took all Courtly pleaſures, Viands, and Delights, from the <hi>Athenians,</hi> although he could not govern nor conquer himſelf, but

                     <p>The like hapned to that ancient and wiſe Phyloſopher <hi>Zeno,</hi> from <hi>Phaleris</hi> the Tirant, in recompence of many good ſervices he had done, cauſed him to be put to a cruel death, the ſame paiment did King <hi>Anachreon</hi> give to <hi>Anaxagaras,</hi> the like reward had <hi>Seneca</hi> from <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> from <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who becauſe he would not acknowledge him to be a God and adore him, he commanded his Hands and Feet to be cut off, his Eyes to be plucked out, his Ears and Noſe to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off, and caſt him into an obſcure Dungeon, where he died.</p>
                     <p>Theſe and the like ends had many other great Favourits and Philoſophers, who would not obey the unjuſt and inhumane Laws and commands of Princes and Monarchs, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſerable and cruel deaths in recompence of all their ſervices and good counſels they had given.</p>
                     <p>We will forbear to reckon up the great multitude of Vices and bad Cuſtomes which alwayes do follow and accompany Courtiers; how amongſt them all things go by contraries, and all humane law and ſociety is perverted and prevericated.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56207:63"/> by the outward appearance) all the pleaſures, delights, and good fortunes of the World were made; for if we do conſider what man hath need of to make his life quiet, pleaſant, and happy, and to enjoy this life in perpetual reſt and contentment, it will appear to our outward view, that Nature hath provided more largely for Princes then for other men.</p>
                     <p>What thing can Man enjoy, &amp; be more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in this life, then in great Riches, aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Temporal Goods, Commands, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, abſolute power and free liberty to act good or evil, or ſhall pleaſe his own palate without contradiction, reprehenſion, or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, power to run with looſe Rain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all ſorts of pleaſures, delights, and paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and to have at his will whatever his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite or reaſon can deſire.</p>
                     <p>All that can be acquired for mans content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his quiet and entertainment, as rich Cup-boards, Veſſels of Gold and Silver to eat and drink in, the many delicious and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meats, great, magnificent, and pompu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervices and furniture, rich Veſtments; and all with a Royal neatneſs and order; with what ever elſe can be deſired to delight the ſenſes, and maintain the pleaſures of Humane concupiſcence, all which they have provided for them without asking, or taking care, even from the Cradle to the Crown.</p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56207:63"/>
                     <p> It's true, if we ſhould look no farther then on the out-ſide of theſe glorious entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſhould be really perſwaded that they alone do enjoy the pleaſures and delights of this life, and that all others live in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual anguiſh and trouble; but if we make a further entrance into theſe things with a juſt ballance weight, and with a true Rule try them, we ſhall finde the ſame things which we count as ſteps to the heighth of felicity, and which will make them arive to the top of happineſs in this life.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the inſtruments and preparations of Vice, by which they become to be more unfortunate and miſerable; of what validity are their rich garments and furniture, gallant, and honourable ſervices, and delicate Viands, with all which they cannot defend themſelves from the falſities and poyſons which may be mixed in them by thoſe about him: We have experience thereof in our dayes. Doth not <hi>Plataria</hi> write, That one Pope was bewitched in his ſenſes, with a paper that was given him by a Servant for a private uſe, to wipe.—</p>
                     <p>Others have been poyſoned by the ſmoak of Torches and Candles.</p>
                     <p>We read in ancient Hiſtories, that ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors durſt not lie down to take their repoſe at night, till firſt they had ſearched the Beds, and diligently looked into all corners and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56207:64"/> in their Bed-chambers, for fear of being murthered when they were ſleeping, and changed their Lodging often.</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtory of our Times can declare the like of that Tirant <hi>CROMWEL,</hi> who was a diligent ſearcher, as above-mentioned, and often few of his own family knew where, or in what Room he lay: What a terrible, gnawing, and continual troubleſome, waking Worm is a guilty Conſcience?</p>
                     <p>Others there are who never would conſent a Barber or Chirurgeon ſhould come near their Faces to ſhave their Beards, leaſt they ſhould cut their Throats.</p>
                     <p>The Kings of our Times are ſo jealous that they dare not eat a bit without a Taſter. Were it not better, ſaith <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> Dye at once, then live ſubject to ſo many jealouſies and fears: But what felicity can any man enjoy that hath ſo many thouſands of men at his charge, under his government and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He muſt watch and hear the complaints and petitions, and ſeek the welfare of all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting with his clemency and liberality ſome to be good, and forcing others to be ſo with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and juſtice: He muſt not be leſs ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to procure and maintain the peace and quiet of his people, then couragious and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant to defend them from the aſſaults in roads and treacheries of their Enemies, without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                        <hi>Pogio Florentino</hi> in a Diſcourſe which he makes concerning the wicked Princes and their infidelity, they commonly ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be governed (or led on) by three ſorts of people, with which they converſe which are moſt pleaſing to them, and which are moſt familiar with them and approved by them.</p>
                     <p>To begin with Flatterers, which deſerve the firſt place, and becauſe they are Capital enemies to the truth, they bewitch their Souls and poyſon their diſpoſitions with ſuch peſtiferous and dangerous potions of tiranny, folly, and vice, that all their Subjects feel the ſmart thereof: They call their folly and raſhneſs, prudence; their cruelty, Juſtice; their diſſolute luxuries and uncleanneſs, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſports: If they are covetous they ſay they are provident: If they are prodigal, they call them liberal; ſo that there is no vice in a King or Prince, which they know not how to mask, paint, and gloſe, under colour of ſome vertue.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond are the Maſter-builders and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venters of Taxes, Exciſes, and Impoſitions,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56207:65"/> the which ſleep not day nor night, to invent ſome new ſtrange way to get money out of the common people for their Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: Theſe invent new Dignities and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to be bought: Theſe take away, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and cut them ſhort again: Theſe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for confiſcations and condemnations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other men; all their ſtudy, diligence, and care, is to gather together, win, obtain, and procure, the Lands, Goods, and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances of the poor people.</p>
                     <p>There is another kinde of men, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence and covert of good, do make of themſelves honourable Hypocrites, who have their aſpect and reach ſo large; that they are alwayes entrapping and diſcuſſing other mens lives and actions, ſeeming to be Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Enemies to vice; they denounce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome good men, and raiſe lies againſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe approve ſuch wickedneſſes, and not onely are cauſe of mens looſing their Eſtates, but many times of their lives, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved no ſuch puniſhment for what alleadged againſt them, neither from God nor Man, for which cauſe the Ancients held a cuſtome (as <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now there remains to our ſerious view nothing worth our notice, but how it fares with married people; what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented life do they lead, after we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ſearched the lives of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal conditions of the World; it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and known thing that if we will in our phanſies imagine, or compoſe in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, an <hi>Idea,</hi> pattern, or copy of a happy Marriage, well endowed with all things can be deſired, as <hi>Plato</hi> did in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipublick, or as Saint <hi>A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>G<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>STINE</hi> did his in <hi>Civitate Dei,</hi> that in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance there is nothing in the World that

                     <p>What greater teſtimony can there be of a true, perfect, and perpetual love, then for a Woman to leave Father, Mother, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Brothers, and Kindred; and even

                     <p>If a Married man will ſit at home, or retire himſelf, he hath a Wife that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually will accompany, diſcourſe with him; and with her loving entertainment expel from him all ſorrow, grief, and melancholly: If he goes a Journey ſhe accompanies him with her Eyes ſo far as her ſight can reach, and being abſent, ſhe honours, deſires, and expects him with tears, ſighs, and complaints: When he

                     <p>Nature can afford us but one Father and Mother, but Matrimony repreſents many to us, giving us Children that do honour, reverence, and love us, more then their own ſelves; for being young, they ſport, they tumble, and play the little Apes, they play the Fools, prattle, and chatter, to give us content, to pleaſe our appetites, and increaſe our mirth with their innocent ſports and paſtimes; ſo that it is in appearance as if Dame Nature had beſtowed on married people for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, ſome Players of interludes, or delightful Jeſters, to paſs a great part of this miſerable life; and when old Age comes upon us, which is a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and of neceſſity muſt come upon all that live long; theſe little Monckies (as

There is made mention of a great famine in <hi>Samaria</hi> in the time of <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, (which exceeded that before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) where there was ſuch want of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that an Aſſe head was ſold for fourſcore peices of Silver, and the fourth part of a kab of Pigions dung for five peices of Silver, but what was worſe, and moſt inhumane of all, that having eaten all the proviſion they had, the Mothers eat their own Children; in ſo much that a woman of the City, complained to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as he went upon the Wall, that her neighbour would not ſtand to an agreement made betwixt them, which was to eat the firſt day her Child, and the next day the other womans; the which (ſaith ſhe) I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, for we boyled my ſon, and did eat him; I ſaid unto her on the next day, give thy Son that we may eat him, and ſhe hath hid him, the which the King hearing, rent his clothes, and behold he had Sackcloth within upon his fleſh, &amp;c. <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his ſeventh Book of the Warres of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> in the third Chapter, relates another accident much like this, but executed with more fury, and after a more ſtrange manner; there was (ſaith he) in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when it was beſeiged a Woman both noble and rich, which had hidden in a

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:56207:122"/> watchfull and with dread expect the dolefull parting of the ſoul and body, that terrible houre of death, which for the moſt part is with anguiſhes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible torments; at the which St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> admiring, he frames a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to God: Lord, after man hath ſuffered ſo many evils, and ſuſtained ſo many afflictions, death follows, which ſuddenly ſnatcheth poore Creatures, and that by divers, ſtrange and infinite ways: ſome with grievous Feavers, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with ſome great pains, ſome with hunger, others with thirſt, ſome in the fire, others in the water; how many with the ſword, poyſons and pure fear? ſome doe drown, ſtrangle and deſtroy themſelves, others are torne in peices with the teeth of cruel and ſavage Creatures; ſome have been wounded and killed by pecking of birds, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have been meat for fiſhes and worms; all this conſidered, no man knows what end he ſhall make, or by which of theſe means his diſſolution ſhall be; for when he deems himſelf moſt firm, healthy and ſtrong, then he is moſt ſubject to fall, and the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt change is then neareſt, and then approaching towards him: death the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:56207:123"/> ſeparation of ſoul and body, which is moſt fearfull, and of all things moſt terrible; Therefore to work upon our apprehenſion, what ſight, what ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is more worth our view and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, then to ſee a man caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſick bed, tormented with the pangs of death, and afflicted to the height therewith; what a horror? what a change is there in all the joynts and parts of his body? what an alteration there is? the feet grow cold, the face turnes yellow, the eye-ſtrings break, and the eyes ſink in, the mouth and lips ſhrink up, the tongue grows black; the teeth chatter; their ſweat is more cold then ice, proceeding from mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall griefs, and are the moſt evident ſignes of the conqueſt of death over nature? for when the ſoul comes to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from its ſo dearly beloved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion? when theſe two ſo antient friends and conſorts comes to take the laſt farewell, embraces, there is no joynt or limbe of nature remaines whole or in order, but they all break; beſides there is the furious aſſaults of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills, the wicked angels, the fearfull viſions and repreſentations, which they make to the ſoul and conſcience of the

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56207:134"/> he had made, that this is true, no man of diſcretion can deny, for to create the light, give being to the Stars, even the greateſt and moſt excellent Creatures, that thoſe from which men doe receive moſt profit and outward refreſhment, which are the Sun, the Moon, and the ſeven Planets; He onely ſaid, <hi>Let there be Light,</hi> a Sun, a Moon, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they appeared in their ſeveral ſphears in the heavens, in obedience to the command of their Creator, with the like words, he parted light from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; he encloſed the waters that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the face of the Earth in one place; his onely will and pleaſure it was to ſet them bounds which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did, or ever ſhall paſſe without his command and pleaſure; finally, his omnipotent power and holy will alone, gives being to all that ever was or ſhall be under the cope of Heaven, all Plants, Trees, Seeds and Animals, enjoy life at his pleaſure; they ſhal live no longer, than his divine bounty pleaſeth; but eſteeming and affecting man more than all the works of his hands; and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to imprint upon him with the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of his ſacred wiſdome, an exact Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of his divine likeneſſe; and that

                  <p>Onely this contemplation would I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to thoſe which ſhall read this ſhort diſcourſe; Which is the excellency and dignity of the ſoule and its faculties, of which, many Authors both Antient and Modern have written much, and to the purpoſe; amongſt them, <hi>Lactantius, Firmianus</hi> in <hi>Latine, Gregorie Niceno</hi> in <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Bartholmew Facio</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the new opinions of many; But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, the Writings of I <hi>heodoritus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Syria, Of the nature of man,</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>French</hi> by <hi>Pedro Roldan,</hi> which have been in great eſteem with all that have peruſed them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are worthy of perpetual memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for which cauſe, I ſhall not ſtay long, to make a large volume of this matter, but rather I ſhall ſtrive to be ſhort or compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious herein, that I may take off ſomthing

Oh what wonderfull things would it act; how rare and ſtrange would its deſignes be, but this lump of clay, the body weighs it down and hinders, which <hi>Mercurius</hi> calls a Tyranical Priſon of the ſoul; for that ever impeds, when this would, ſet forth its divine Eſſence; but when it goes forth of this body by contemplation and meditation, and freeth it ſelf from the weighty burthen thereof ſubjecting the vitious appetites of it, it no ſooner remaines at liberty, but receives the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble influences of Heaven, and being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and cleanſed from the filthineſſe of theſe earthly members, goes skipping in the Aire from Element to Element, holds communication and converſe with the Angels, and can Penetrate even to the

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56207:161"/> men generally are moſt blockiſh, ſlow and ſottiſh: Therefore it appeared better that man ſhould be created of fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> more delicate, lively and tender; that it might not be too heavy a clog, or hindrance in the underſtanding and knowledge of things to the ſoule; but that (as it doth) it might act the more freely, in the which is palpably ſeen the ſoveraign wiſdome of the Artificer, or framer of this ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a work; as alſo in other things, which he would not give to man at his Birth, which are ſuch conveniencies and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as he beſtowed upon the Animals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew well that man with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and providential induſtry would obtain and purchaſe what they enjoy with any other thing whatſoever; and that he would accommodate himſelf better than all the other Creatures; although he were created and born, naked and void of all arms, either offenſive or defenſive; and they came into the world, decked, adorned, and endowed, with horns, teeths, beakes, poyſons, ſtings, ſcales, and ſhels: Inſteed of which, God beſtowed upon him the Government of Reaſon, the weapons of the underſtanding, with the which the ſoul, not the body is armed and defended; and are ſufficient to tame, ſubject and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56207:161"/> bring under foot all the other creatures; the great power and force of Beaſts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt this thing called Reaſon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſharpeneſſe nor hardneſſe of their Hornes and Claws, nor thoſe great bodies compoſed of fleſh and bones, it forcibly ſubjects them, not with greater ſtrength, but with ſubtilty, cunning and activity, whereby it ſerves and benefits it ſelf of them at its pleaſure; For there is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how great, ſtrange, hardy, bold, feirce, furious or fearfull ſoever it be; Yet when it ſeeth man, although it never had ſeen him, or his like before, but it trembles and is fearfull, or at leaſt ſhews reſpect, this Majeſty he retaines ſtill, which he inherited from that firſt impreſſion which God ſtamped upon <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which the Antient <hi>Cabiliſts</hi> called in their Language <hi>Phahat;</hi> With this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the firſt man did boldly live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt, and converſe with ſo many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, ſtrong and feirce Beaſts, giving a name to each, according to its kinde, Hereby he purchaſed ſo great a power and dominion over them, that they all did fear, honor and reverence him as ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, and abſolute King over them.</p>
                     <p>But ſo ſoon as he was negligent, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56207:162"/> forgetfull of himſelf, proved in gratefull and ſinned againſt his God; that image was blurred, though not totally blotted out, and he loſt almoſt all that power and command, which he had over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; from the root and relicks of which remained, and we inherited of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; proceeded, that many holy men inhabiting the Deſerts, ſlept, eat, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely converſed with feirce Beaſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out receiving any harme, Entred into their Dens or Caves, as into their own houſes, and lived amongſt them, as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Parents and Friends, without any fear: We read of <hi>Samſon, David</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> who went amongſt Lions as amongſt Lambs; <hi>Eliſha</hi> commanded the Beares, as if they had been his ſlaves, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> received no hurt from the Viper.</p>
                     <p>Now it will be convenient in a few words, to give anſwer to what we alleaged in the former book of the miſeries of this life; When we ſet forth the vile and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picable eſtate of man; ſaying, that he was of ſo ſmall a value and ſhort conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, that many of the Animals far exceeded him; Sure there will be none ſo fooliſhly bold, that dare to ſay, God beſtowed more benefits and favours upon other creatures then upon man. I believe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56207:162"/> not, for although he created him of ſo baſe and low a ſubſtance as the duſt of the earth; Yet he loſt not thereby one point of his dignity, authority and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; for we know he made him of ſo vile and invalied a matter; Not becauſe he wanted more noble Elements, out of which to forme him, for the creation of the Sun, the Moon and the Starrs, does ſufficiently declare the contrary; but He was pleaſed to create him of clay, to be a clog, to abate his Pride and vain-glory; which were the totall deſtruction, and firſt cauſe of the baniſhment of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſterity out of Paradice; alſo to give him to underſtand, that there is within him ſomething that cannot employ, and detaine it ſelf in ſublunary and terrenal things, nor place its end, felicity and bliſſe upon them; as brute beaſts doe, that enjoy all their happineſſe in this life, and it ends with them; but man, all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie, his life, his honour and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bliſſe and quiet, conſiſts in ſetting all his thoughts and meditations on heaven; lifting up his eyes to the Hills, from whence cometh his help, and where he hath a place of perpetual abode and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, a certain houſe of pleaſure and reſt, where he ever ought to be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56207:163"/> lands and inheritances, by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent life and good converſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to obtain everlaſting happineſſe, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory; If I ſaid, he was laden with miſeries, and ſubject to an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of infirmities, troubles, and ſorrows, its true, I do not deny it; But God did not create him at firſt ſubject to ſo many miſhaps, diſaſters and caſualties; he made him a free denizen of this world; not to pay tributes or exciſes, for he placed him in the higheſt dignity and degree therein; if he be miſerable, if he ſuffers evills, if he be ſubject to weakneſſe, infirmities, and ſorrows, he brought them upon himſelf; he ſought them out with his own hands ſo ſoon as he parted from his creator; by not endeavouring to follow that holy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto which at firſt he was called; if he had known how, (or to ſay better) would have known how to have kept that excellent treaſure of grace that then was beſtowed upon him; his omnipotent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor would have maintained him, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual felicity and honour; Yet ſuch is the abundant mercy of God, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for his offences, he brought him under ſo many miſeries and afflictions, he did it not for any rancor or odium a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; for onely in regard of his love
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56207:163"/> and affection towards man, he did not pardon his onely Son, but delivered him into the hands of his enemies, which ſo barborouſly murdred him, as by ſacred writ we certainly know and believe; pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſo vile and horrid a death tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, the price of that otherwaies irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable death eternal which we owed, and deſerved: If he made us of earth, it was to bring down the exceeding hautineſſe, of mens fancies, to pluck out from our hearts by the root, that peſtiferious herb of Pride, and vanity, which the devil our envious adverſary planted in them, to keep us captive under his command and will; this is the main cauſe why man is ſo overcharged with troubles and ſorrows, ſo full of grief, anguiſh and afflictions, made corruptible &amp; mortall; but if man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to be a captive, a ſlave, and ſubject to ſuch and ſo many vexations, conſidering himſelf ſo miſerable, ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and afflicted, is ſo boaſting and hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; What would he doe if he were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, impaſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and incorruptible I without any miſery or ſorrow and all things ſucceeded to him as he could wiſh or deſire? For this cauſe God with a mighty hand ſubjected him to miſeries and afflictions; yet for all, hitherto he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56207:164"/> hath kept, and ever hereafter will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in this mortall, weak, and frail veſſel of earth, ſo ſweet an according harmony, conformity and unity, that its impoſſible to imagine any thing ſo beautifull, exact and compleat; But to be brief, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe in few words what I have declared in many, to place man in his laſt, greateſt and higheſt perfection, and ſet him forth with the moſt exquiſite praiſes that we can; therefore lets conſider him in that perfect eſtate and condition, in the which he was created, and we ſhall finde man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to be the work which God made, to ſhew his great magnificence, wiſdom and power, the immenſity of his knowledge, and the infiniteneſſe of his bounty; But if we contemplate him in the eſtate of general corruption, which <hi>Adam</hi> left us as a legitimate inheritance, a ſpot (farr worſe then that of oyle) which is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſhed upon all his poſterity, we ſhall finde it very foule, monſtruouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, low, filthy, and deformed, ſubject to a thouſand miſeries, baniſhed from all good, maimed, fooliſh, inconſtant, a hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, and in concluſion, inſtead of King and abſolute Lord (as he was) of all the creatures, a ſlave and a ſervant of ſin with which he was conceived and borne.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56207:164"/> But if at laſt we ſeriouſly contemplate and conſider him renowned, by the vertue &amp; power of the word of Almighty God, we ſhall finde him not only reeſtated, &amp; rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned in thoſe priſtine graces and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which he at firſt enjoyed, but much more exalted in harmony, might &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment; for where there is the greateſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of ſins, there (if a true ſtrength of contrition) is found the moſt full and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing current of grace, mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our God, to waſh away the ſpots blemiſhes and deformities made by ſin, and to renew the creature, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes at large in his book of the <hi>Vocation of the Nations, chap.</hi> 3. and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Book of <hi>Grace and Correction,</hi> chap. 10. We all of us ought, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, ſeriouſly conſidering and acknowledging, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of mercies God hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; to bleſſe, praiſe, magnify and give him thanks that we were borne men and not beaſts; and although in this mortall fragil &amp; periſhable life, we may meet with many thornes, prickles and afflictions; which we cannot ſo eaſily digeſt as we ought, beſides thoſe civill Warrs waged betwixt the ſoul and the body, in which it lies ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as in a priſon, or buried as in a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; yet that he is pleaſed to give us grace
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56207:165"/> alwayes to be ſtriving, labouring, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, and that with unwearied affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to run that Race, to walk in that Path, which leads us to the holy City of our God, that heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where there is no hunger or thirſt, no colds or heats; there we ſhall be free from all the evills, miſeries and calamities, which in this world do attend us; yet its certain, walking in this valey of ſorrows, ſailing in this frail body, as in a ſhip made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to tranſport the ſoule to that haven of quietneſſe, reſt and happineſſe, while ſhe ſtayes here, ſhe muſt trip, ſtumble, fall, riſe and fall again; ſuch is the variableneſſe of our being in this life; nay rather the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of this ſhaddow of life; But once arriving into that harbour where all ſafety dwels, and unto which all hope to attain, that is, to a finall perfection, ſhe ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and impoſſible, ful of thoſe flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyes which ſhal never fade or wither away, full of perpetual peace, reſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; enjoying that Antient and Original degree of Dignity and Honour; which her malicious and curſed enemy the Devil, would have deprived her off; Unto the which felicity and eternal happineſs bring and conduct us: <hi>He who with the Father and the holy Spirit of Grace, liveth and Reigneth, ever one God, world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end,</hi> Amen.</p>
